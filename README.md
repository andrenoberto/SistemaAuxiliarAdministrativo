A simple system that can schedule the use of projectors inside a university.
For the future we might be able to administrate extra activities from the students.

# Additional Notes
It uses some design patterns that I first learn when i was going to advanced programming classes. Although it doesn't have any complex code I still think this is a good place for those whom are learning advanced programming and design patterns stuff.
